## Introduction

**MLPNoLib** is a minimalist implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
written in C++ without using any external libraries. This project showcases the
foundational principles of neural networks, from forward propagation to
backpropagation.

---

## Features

- **Pure C++ Implementation**: No external dependencies.
- **Flexible Architecture**: Easily customizable network structure, save and load trained models.
- **Tasks**: Classification and predictions (97% accuracy on MNIST test set).
- **Interactive GUI** (optional): Provide a gui with SFML to draw MNIST samples.
- **Evaluation Tools**: k-fold cross-validation.

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed as an educational tool to demonstrate how neural
networks work at a fundamental level. It is inspired by the simplicity of
neural network implementations in Python libraries like NumPy but translated
into C++ for better understanding of low-level operations.
